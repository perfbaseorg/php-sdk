A PHP SDK designed to facilitate seamless application profiling and performance monitoring with Perfbase. This SDK offers extensive configurability and enhanced profiling features for integration into your PHP applications.

## Important: Using a PHP Framework?
If you are already using a PHP framework, we highly recommend utilizing one of our dedicated framework integrations. We provide out-of-the-box support for popular frameworks, including Laravel, Symfony, and others.

If you're NOT using a framework - this is the SDK for you!

## Documentation
Comprehensive documentation for all Perfbase libraries is available at: [https://docs.perfbase.com](https://docs.perfbase.com), including detailed information about data handling policies, security measures, legalities, and specifics on what data is transferred and how it is stored.

## Installation

Install the package via composer:

```bash
composer require perfbase/php-sdk
```

## Requirements

- PHP version `7.4` â†’ `8.4`.
- Composer 
- `ext-curl`, `ext-json`, `ext-zlib` (Note: these are usually enabled by default)
- The `perfbase` PHP extension installed and enabled.

## Quick Start

```php
use Perfbase\SDK\Perfbase;
use Perfbase\SDK\Config;

// Initialize the client with configuration
$config = new Config('YOUR_API_KEY');

// Create a new instance of the Perfbase SDK
$perfbase = new Perfbase($config);

// Create a new profiling instance
$instance = $perfbase->createInstance($config);
$instance->startProfiling();

// Your code here
// ...

// Stop profiling and send data to Perfbase
$instance->stopProfiling();

// Complete!
```

## Configuration

You can configure the SDK using direct initialization or an array:

```php
// Direct initialization
$config = new Config(
    api_key: 'YOUR_API_KEY',
    track_file_operations: true
    // ...
);

// Using an array
$config = Config::fromArray([
    'api_key' => 'YOUR_API_KEY',
    'track_pdo' => true,
    'track_caches' => true
    // ...
]);
```
